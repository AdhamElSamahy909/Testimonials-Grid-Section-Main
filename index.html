       <p class="bold-quote">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
       in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>

       <p class="quote quote-daniel">‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a 
       transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
       for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
       The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
       the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

      <P class="quote quote-patrick">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
       gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
       junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
       an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</P>

      <p class="bold-quote">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

      <p class="quote quote-kira">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
       professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
       student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
       did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
       project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
       could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
       experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
       100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
